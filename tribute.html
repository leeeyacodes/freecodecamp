    <p>Spirited Away is a Japanese animated film written and produced by Hayao Miyazaki along with the animation studio, Studio Ghibli. Spirited Away tells a story about a young girl named Chihiro and her parents. On their way to move to a new town, they come across an abandoned theme park. Guarded already about moving to a new town, Chihiro reluctantly follows her parents and explores the park. There her parents get lured by the smell of delicious food set out at one of the booths, even stopping to eat it without asking and against Chihiro's wishes. As night falls, creep sets in...and the spirits come out. Chihiro rushes to her parents to find them morphed into giant pigs and frantically tries to escape the park. Amidst the craze, Haku, a spirit, comes to her aid and sets off Chihiro's journey to rescue her parents and leave the park. </p>
